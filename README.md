# Portfolio
This Is my portfolio. I plan on updating it regularly, and adding projects as I complete them. 

This portfolio is version 1.0

I have learned some very useful informaiton, while getting to know bootstrap.
Bootstrap is a very competent toll for responsive design. I have ejoyed getting to know it.

In this portfolio you will find:

* Consistant navigation whether on desktop or mobile.

* Responsive page elements and images that adapt well to varying screen sizes.

* Zero use of media queries.

* Functioning and responsive card columns on the portfolio page.

* Links that work.

* Semantic HTML.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

* Functional, deployed application

* Bootstrap components, ie containers on all pages, a grid system using columns and rows on the About page(index.html,
  while utilizing Boostrap's Card Columns system on the portfolio.html page.
  
*BONUS* A sticky footer was made using the class="fixed-bottom" borrowed from Bootstrap navbar settings.

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* All pages, both HTML and CSS were validated using W3Schools https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
